# SAT-GPA Analysis

## Scenario

You are a data analyst working for a university admissions department. Your department is keen on understanding the relationship between SAT scores and GPAs of previous applicants to gain insights into academic performance metrics for admissions decisions. You have been tasked with conducting an analysis that includes data exploration, visualization, linear regression modeling, and evaluation.

## Data Exploration

The dataset provided contains information on the SAT scores and GPAs of previous university applicants. Key characteristics of the dataset include:

- Number of records: [insert number]
- Mean SAT score: [insert mean]
- Median SAT score: [insert median]
- Mean GPA: [insert mean]
- Median GPA: [insert median]
- Standard deviation of SAT scores: [insert standard deviation]
- Standard deviation of GPAs: [insert standard deviation]

## Visualization

A scatter plot is utilized to visualize the relationship between SAT scores and GPAs. Additionally, a histogram illustrates the distribution of GPAs.

## Linear Regression Modeling

The data is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. A linear regression model is then fitted to the training data to predict GPAs based on SAT scores.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and mean squared error. Residual analysis is conducted to assess the model's fit to the data.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for conducting analyses related to SAT scores and GPAs in the context of university admissions. It includes code, visualizations, and documentation aimed at providing actionable insights for admissions decision-making.
